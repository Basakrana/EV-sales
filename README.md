Project Challenge: Codebasics Resume Project Challenge 12
Presented By: Rana Basak

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze electric vehicle (EV) sales data across Indian states to uncover trends, identify discrepancies, and provide insights for promoting electric mobility in India. The analysis covers data from April 2021 to April 2024, sourced from Codebasics using Vahan Sewa data.

## Datasets Overview

Electric Vehicle Sales by State

Monthly sales data categorized by vehicle type (2-Wheeler or 4-Wheeler) and state.

Includes date, number of EVs sold, and total vehicle sales.

Electric Vehicle Sales by Makers

Sales data by manufacturer, categorized by vehicle type.

Contains date, vehicle category, manufacturer, and number of EVs sold.

Date Dimension

Provides time-series details including specific dates, fiscal years, and quarters for detailed trend analysis.

ðŸ›  Data Correction & Standardization

Data Entry Error Correction:

A discrepancy was found in Kerala for the fiscal year 2024:

January total vehicles sold = 164 (seemed too low)

Electric vehicles sold = 734

This inconsistency suggested a data entry error.

Correction: Replaced the total vehicle count with the median of total vehicle sales values for Kerala in fiscal year 2024 for the 4-wheeler category.

Median value chosen = 13,932 (avoiding skew caused by the extreme outlier 164).

## ðŸ“Š Objectives & Analysis Goals

Identify EV adoption trends across states and vehicle types.

Compare EV sales among different manufacturers.

Analyze time-series trends across fiscal years and quarters.

Detect data anomalies and correct inconsistencies for accurate reporting.

Provide insights to support policy-making and promotion of EVs in India.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Highlights

EV sales for 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers show state-wise adoption trends.

Manufacturer-level analysis helps identify market leaders and growth patterns.

Time-series data allows seasonal and fiscal trend identification.

Data cleaning ensures accuracy and reliability of insights.
